# Hello Everyone
  
### Date 11-09-2020
This is my first blog post. I'm doing this because I was inspired by [_Learn in public_](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)
article. I'll be doing a lot of creative writing here, but I'll try to improve on my language as I do more blog posts.
Also, as a challenge I'll try to write here at leas once a month. Topics covered will be related to things I've read about during
the week which can be economics/statistics/computer science and what not. This will be my outlet where I can learn in 
public.

Here's a qute from the article that really hit home:

>If there's a golden rule, it's this one, so I put it first. All the other rules are more or less elaborations of this 
rule #1.
> 
>You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people "learn in private", and lurk. They consume 
>content without creating any themselves. Again, that's fine, but we're here to talk about being in the top quintile. 
>What you do here is to have a habit of creating learning exhaust:
> ```
> - Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.
> - Speak at meetups and conferences.
> - Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. 
> - Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, they're not public.
> - Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams.
> - Start a newsletter.
> - Draw cartoons (people loooove cartoons!).
> ```
>Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning. Don't judge your results by 
>"claps" or retweets or stars or upvotes - just talk to yourself from 3 months ago. I keep an almost-daily dev blog 
>written for no one else but me.
>
>Guess what? It's not about reaching as many people as possible with your content. If you can do that, great, remember 
>me when you're famous. But chances are that by far the biggest beneficiary of you trying to help past you is future 
>you. If others benefit, that's icing.
>
>Oh you think you're done? Don't stop there:
>- Enjoyed a coding video? Reach out to the speaker/instructor and thank them, and ask questions.
>- Make PR's to libraries you use.
>- Make your own libraries no one will ever use.
>- Clone stuff you like, from scratch, to see how they work.
>- Teach workshops.
>- Go to conferences and summarize what you learned.
>
>If you're tired of creating one-off things, start building a persistent knowledge base that grows over time. Open 
>Source your Knowledge! At every step of the way: Document what you did and the problems you solved.
